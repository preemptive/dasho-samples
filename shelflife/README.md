# Shelf Life Samples

## Setup

These samples have the same basic tool and environment requirements as the [Java](../java/README.md) samples.

Before running the Shelf Life samples you need to place your [shelf life key](https://www.preemptive.com/dasho/pro/userguide/en/checks_shelf.html) in this directory and rename it to `sample.slkey`.

## Samples

* [basic](basic) - Use Shelf Life to add an expiration date to a hello world application.
* [customaction](customaction) - Use a custom expiration action to bring up dialogs when the application has expired.
* [relativestart](relativestart) - Expire an application a certain number of days from a dynamic start date.
* [tokensource](tokensource) - Read the expiration token from an external source, in this case from resources.
