# Shelf Life Samples

## Setup

These samples have the same basic tool and environment requirements as the [Java](../java/README.md) samples.

Before running the Shelf Life samples you need to place your [shelf life key](https://www.preemptive.com/dasho/pro/userguide/en/checks_shelf.html) in this directory and rename it to `sample.slkey`.
